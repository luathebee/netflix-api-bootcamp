# Netflix API - BackEnd

Backend API for a netflix clone

Featuring:
* MySQL BD Integration
* CRUD for Users, Shows and Episodes
* User authentication

### Self Assessment
It took me some time to keep up with all the lessons and to implement all of the features.
Cruds are functional. Authentication works.
Features mentioned below were not added due to time constraint.
#### To Do:
* Fix Exception Treatment (errorHandler)
  * Hangs - does not return
* Implement User List
* Add winston for Logging
* Implement testing with Jest
* Replace jwtgit secrets with dotenv
